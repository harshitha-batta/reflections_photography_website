The project focuses on building a Photo Gallery Application with user authentication, category-based image organization, and interactive features. The application leverages modern web development technologies, including MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js, and EJS templates, to provide a user-friendly and functional platform for uploading, managing, and viewing images.

Objective

The primary goal of the project was to develop a dynamic and interactive photo gallery application where users can:

Upload and Manage Photos: Users can upload images with details such as titles, categories, and descriptions.

User Authentication: Implement user registration and login systems with role-based access controls.

Categorization: Photos are organized into categories for better navigation and searchability.

Interactivity: Users can interact with images by adding comments and exploring posts by others.

Problems Addressed

We aimed to address the following problems:

Building a platform where users can organize and manage photos efficiently.

Implementing secure authentication to ensure user data privacy.

Enabling seamless categorization and search features for better user experience.

Providing admin capabilities to manage users and photo categories.

Additional Features

Beyond the listed assignment requirements, we implemented the following features:

Commenting System: Users can leave comments on photos to foster interaction.

Photo Migration Tool: A utility script (migratePhotoCategories.js) was developed to assist in reorganizing photo categories.

Admin Promotions: Admins can promote standard users to admin roles using a utility script (promoToAdmin.js).

Data Cleanup: Added functionality to identify and clean orphaned data with the cleanupOrphanedData.js script.

Flash Notifications: Implemented feedback notifications using the flash.js utility for a smoother user experience.

Responsive Design: Ensured the application is responsive by designing modular CSS files for key pages like login, gallery, and profile views.
